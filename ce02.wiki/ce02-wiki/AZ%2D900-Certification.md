## Booking the exam
 
1. When you register for the exam please do so using a personal email account. You need to use a personal email as this is how the system preserves the certifications if you move between organizations. 

   When the system asks for your **Microsoft Account** it is asking for your personal email address. I have attached some very simply instructions about how you then associate your certificate to Kubrick. 
 
2.	When scheduling the exam select:
*	The country as UK
*	Choose the ‘Schedule with Pearson VUE’
*	Later within the booking you will have an opportunity to use the voucher code to set the cost to £0.00
 
3.	If you fail the exam, then the re-take will be at your personal cost.
 
4.	You should have taken and completed the az-900 exam before Saturday 1/1/2022. 
 
The voucher codes will be set to you individually.
