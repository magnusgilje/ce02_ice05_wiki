This is what you really came for. Find attached all the links to all the various diagrams, documentations, and cheat-y stuff that you need to keep the wheels turning.

# System

## The Command Line

You may not be in the matrix, but you can try your best to get there with this [cheat sheet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/). It's for Linux, but a lot of them are similar to Windows's CMD commands.

## The Cloud

### Service Models

- On Premises: You have a phat, and I mean _**phat**_, server sitting in your front room.
   - Example: You have all the parts to make a computer.
- Infrastructure as a Service: The server now sits in the datacentre. You've just got to worry about the OS and everything in it.
   - Example: You have a laptop with *nothing* on it.
- Platform as a Service: The OS is now out of your hands. You just have to get your applications working.
   - Example: You have an iPhone.
- Software as a Service: It's just you and your end product now.
   - Example: You use MS Word.

# Data

Data is managed in databases. There are **relational** and **non-relational** databases that differ only in that one is super strict and the other isn't.

Data lifecycles are broadly described as being **Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)** or **Extract, Load, Transform (ELT)**. Each has its use cases.

It all eventually gets fed into something like PowerBI or other tool to make nice colours.

## SQL

A querying language as well as a platform. SQL deals with relational databases and is probably the most common database querying language.

## Security

- Confidentiality: How easy is it to see for people (applications) who *shouldn't* see it.
- Integrity: How correct is it?
- Accessibility: How easy is it to see for people (applications) who *should* see it.

# Development

## Python

Probably one of the most popular coding languages for its flexibility and ease of understanding. Check out their documentation [here](https://docs.python.org) to see if what you're doing is impossible.

## Pipelines

A pipeline is a set of automated actions that guide the flow of development. They facilitate Continuous Integration, Continuous Development, Continuous Feedback, and Continuous Operations.

A few key providers are Azure DevOps, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and Team City.

# Tooling

## Infrastructure as Code

Infrastructure as code describes an approach to administering IT systems that declares infrastructure configurations. The advantages of IAC are repeatability, standardisation, and version control.

### Terraform

Terraform handles resource provisioning.

Additionally useful for lifecycle management. `terraform destroy` ensures no pesky resources are left behind on close-out and that everything created is appropriately removed.

Surprisingly useful. If you're stuck with TF, check out the documentation [here](https://www.terraform.io/docs).

### Ansible

Whereas Terraform handles provisioning, Ansible handles the configuration of the things you've just provisioned.

Check out what they have to say for themselves [here](https://docs.ansible.com/).

## Containerisation

**Containers** are standardised units containing source code and the software infrastructure, OS libraries, requirements, and dependencies required to run it.

### Docker

Docker delivers **OS-level virtualisation**, simplifying the process of building, running, managing and distributing applications.

Containers are useful for serving applications and as such are integral to anything that wants to be scalable.

Docker's reference documentation lives [here](https://docs.docker.com/reference/).

### Kubernetes

Kubernetes manages containers. There you go! That's all it is!

Kubernetes lets you deploy, scale out, and manage containers to meet varying demand flexibly.

Kubernetes's own cheat sheet [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/).
