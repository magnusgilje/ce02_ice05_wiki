# Describe core solutions and management tools on Azure

## Describe core solutions available in Azure
1. describe the benefits and usage of Internet of Things (IoT) Hub, IoT Central, and Azure Sphere

Internet of Things (IoT) **Hub** - IoT enables devices to gather and then relay information for data analysis. allows for command and control.
if you want to just send and receive messages from devices, just use this

IoT central - connect, monitor, and manage your IoT devices.
Builds on IoT hub. Its allows you to do more things. more complex, if you want a control panel lmao.

Azure Sphere - end-to-end, highly secure IoT solution for customers that encompasses everything from the hardware and operating system on the device to the secure method of sending messages from the device to the message hub.
its literally just like a vpn. Highest security 

2. describe the benefits and usage of Azure Synapse Analytics, HDInsight, and Azure Databricks

Azure Synapse Analytics:

HDInsight:

Azure Databricks: 

3. describe the benefits and usage of Azure Machine Learning, Cognitive Services and Azure Bot Service

Azure Machine Learning: platform for making predictions. data to train and test models to find one that will most accurately predict a future result.
learns from data without having to right code.

Cognitive Services: provides prebuilt machine learning models that enable applications to see, hear, speak, understand, and even begin to reason.

Azure Bot Service: Framework are platforms for creating virtual agents that understand and reply to questions just like a human. creates a virtual agent that can intelligently communicate with humans. ITS LITERALLY JUST A BOT

4. describe the benefits and usage of serverless computing solutions that include Azure Functions and Logic Apps 5 describe the benefits and usage of Azure DevOps, GitHub, GitHub Actions, and Azure DevTest Labs











# Describe general security and network security features
## Describe Azure management tools

1.  describe the functionality and usage of the Azure Portal, Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, Cloud Shell, and Azure Mobile App

- Azure Portal
- Azure PowerShell
- Azure CLI
- Cloud Shell
- Azure Mobile App



2. describe the functionality and usage of Azure Advisor

making sure you're using all the best practises for things, we're not all experts at all resources

3. describe the functionality and usage of Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates


4. describe the functionality and usage of Azure Monitor


built-in platform monitoring service that provides a single pipeline for monitoring and diagnostics data across all Azure resource types, enabling you to easily monitor, diagnose, alert,









5. describe the functionality and usage of Azure Service Health



logic apps for workflow
data synapse - store and run complex queries. storage accounts just store


Azure PowerShell and azure CLI is available for Windows, Linux, and Mac, and you can access it in a web browser via Azure Cloud Shell


By contrast, it's entirely possible to use either PowerShell or the Azure CLI to set up all the resources for a deployment. However, there's no validation step in these tools. thats why u need ARM templates, Azure Resource Manager templates

Azure AD free doesnt come with SLA, but azure AD basic has sla of 99.9%

cosmos is more for mobile apps
