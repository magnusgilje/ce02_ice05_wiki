These are the other beginner/fundamental certifications from Microsoft. Whilst not compulsory, some of the concepts covered may be of use to us cloud engineers and can add some context to the kinds of things that we're doing.

The resources for each certification can be found by going to the certification page and then selecting "Online - Free" under the "Two ways to prepare" section (about where the page changes its background colour).
